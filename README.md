A very small Spark Gap Tesla Coil
=================================

_Some of you may have seen this at 37c3._

I had some stuff laying around and decided that I should build another Tesla Coil. I have done that before, but SSTCs.

Vague parameters:
- Powered by two 850mAh LiPo cells from e-vapes collected from the street.
- About 100mm secondary winding length, 30mm diameter, 0.2mm wire.
- Royer converter to 4kV as a high voltage source.
- 30mm fan from a 3D printer hotend as a rotary spark gap.
- 2x 10nF/2kV film caps as primary capacitance.
- Lots of 3D printed parts.

The entire design is driven by stuff I had lying around, no new parts were bought. It's not all scrap either, though.

_More thoughts on design and construction to follow._
